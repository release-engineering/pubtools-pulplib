    Pulp objects use `attrs <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/>`_.
    Attributes are immutable. Helper functions such as :func:`attr.evolve`
    may be used to produce new instances.

    Attributes exposed on these Pulp objects include some generic attributes
    applicable to any Pulp installation, but also some custom attributes

    Pulp servers.
