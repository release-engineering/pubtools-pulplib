## [Unreleased]

- Added `version`, `display_order` fields to `FileUnit`.
- The `ud_file_release_mappings_2` repository note is now set on repos during publish.

## [2.22.0] - 2022-01-25

- Added `pulp_repository_pre_publish` pubtools hook.

## [2.21.0] - 2021-12-15

- Added support for orphaned units to fake client.
- The `cdn_published` field now accepts ISO8601-format timestamps.
- It is no longer possible to store duplicates in the `repository_memberships` field.

## [2.20.0] - 2021-12-10

- Added many new fields: `ModulemdUnit.dependencies`, `FileUnit.description`,
  `cdn_published` and `cdn_path` on files and RPMs, and `unit_id` on all units.
- Introduced concept of "mutable fields", which may be set during upload or using
  the new `update_content` method.

## [2.19.0] - 2021-12-06

### Fixed

- Fix `copy_content` on fake client failing to update `repository_memberships` field.

### Added

- Added `Client.search_task` for searching tasks.
- Added `requires` and `provides` attrs to `RpmUnit` class.

### Changed

- `Criteria`, `Matcher` objects now stringify more concisely.

## [2.18.0] - 2021-11-29

- Added `basic_auth_username`, `basic_auth_password` to `SyncOptions` to support
  authenticated sync tasks.
- Fake client now accurately reproduces Pulp server behavior around replacing an
  existing file/iso unit.

## [2.17.0] - 2021-10-27

- Added upload support for more content types to `YumRepository`: `upload_comps_xml`,
  `upload_erratum`, `upload_metadata`, `upload_modules`.
- Added unit models for more content types: `ErratumUnit`, `YumRepoMetadataFileUnit`.
- Added `Client.copy_content` for copying content from one repository to another.
- Changed `FileUnit` schema to accept non-integer values of `size` during load, for
  compatibility with some legacy data.
- Fixed `Task` schema too strict, formely being unable to load certain kinds of tasks
  (such as removing orphans).
- Added more verbose logging on errors during load of Pulp data.

## [2.16.0] - 2021-09-30

- Added `YumRepository.upload_rpm`.
- Internal refactoring and changes to logging of uploads.

## [2.15.0] - 2021-09-13

### Added

- Added `content_type_id` attribute to `ModuldemdDefaultsUnit` class.

## [2.14.0] - 2021-09-02

### Added

- Introduced `Criteria.with_unit_type`, to search for content of a specific type.

### Fixed

- Fixed `search_content` repeatedly querying Pulp for content type IDs.
- Fixed `upload_file` on test client not updating repository content.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `FakeController.upload_history`. Repository content should be checked instead.

## [2.13.0] - 2021-08-24

- Searching for RPMs by sha256sum will now use the indexed `checksum` field on Pulp,
  rather than the non-indexed `checksums.sha256` field. This can significantly improve
  the performance of these searches on large systems.
- The `repository_memberships` field will now be populated in units returned from
  `search_content`.
- The `repository_memberships` field will now always be sorted to ensure stable behavior.

## [2.12.1] - 2021-08-11

- Fixed handling of `type_ids` in calls to `remove_content`. Previously, the argument
  did not result in filtering by type as expected.

## [2.12.0] - 2021-07-26

### Added

- `Client` instances can now be used in a `with` statement to manage the lifecycle
  of the underlying threads.

## [2.11.0] - 2021-07-15

### Added

- Introduced `pulp_repository_published` hook. This may be used to subscribe to all
  repository publish events triggered by this library.

### Changed

- Internal refactoring for improved debuggability.

## [2.10.0] - 2021-06-28

### Added
- Filename attribute for RpmUnit class
- nsvca property for ModulemdUnit class

  related binary, debug and source repository

## [2.7.0] - 2020-06-11

### Fixed
- Use repo id as registry_id when it's not set in distributor config or set to null or empty string

## [2.6.0] - 2020-05-05

### Added
- sourcerpm attribute for Rpm unit
- client.search_content method
- Introduced 'population_sources' and 'ubi_population' attributes for yum repository

### Fixed
- 'stream' and 'profiles' are now optional on modulemd_defaults units, rather
  than incorrectly mandatory (leading to schema validation errors)

## [2.5.0] - 2020-02-25

### Added
- Introduced `Repository.sync` API (and associated `SyncOptions` classes)
  for synchronizing Pulp repositories.

## [2.4.0] - 2020-01-13

### Added
- Introduced `Repository.search_content` API for retrieving content units
  from Pulp repositories.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that export an empty maintenance report would crash.
- Fixed another bug that maintenance report could have an invalid `last_updated_by` value.

## [2.3.1] - 2019-10-03

### Fixed
- Fixed certain exceptions from requests library not being propagated properly while
  getting maintenance report.

### Changed

## [2.2.0] - 2019-09-16

### Added

- Added a new attribute `relative_url` to `Distributor`, so users can search distributors
  by relative_url

## [2.1.0] - 2019-09-10

### Added
- A `search_distributor` API to search distributors on defined `Criteria`
- `Matcher.less_than()` matcher to find the results with fields less than
  the given value

### Fixed
- Fixed certain exceptions from requests library (such as SSL handshake errors) not being
  propagated correctly.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-09-09

### Added
- ``Page`` objects may now be directly used as iterables

### Changed
- **API break**: types of fields on model objects are now strictly validated
  during construction.
- **API break**: objects documented as immutable are now more deeply immutable;
  it is no longer possible to mutate list fields on these objects.
- **API break**: fixed inconsistencies on collection model fields. All fields
  previously declared as tuples have been updated to use (immutable) lists.

### Fixed
- **API break**: `MaintenanceReport.last_updated`, `MaintenanceEntry.started`
  are now `datetime` objects as documented. In previous versions, these were
  documented as datetimes but implemented as `str`.

### Added
- Support querying and updating maintenance mode of Pulp repositories

## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-15

### Added

- Introduced ``Repository.is_temporary`` attribute
- Extended search functionality; it is now possible to search using fields defined
  on the `PulpObject` classes. Searching on raw Pulp fields remains supported.

### Fixed
- Fixed inconsistency between real and fake clients: both clients now immediately raise
  if a search is attempted with invalid criteria.  Previously, the fake client would
  instead return a failed `Future`.

### Fixed
- Fixed import conflicts for `pubtools` module

## [1.2.0] - 2019-08-07
